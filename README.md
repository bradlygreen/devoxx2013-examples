Devoxx 2013 Examples
===================

Example code I used in the AngularJS University session at Devoxx 2013 in Antwerp.

Nothing too interesting here, though the 7-mail-app directory may be useful for folks new to AngularJS who want to see how to set up deep linking that includes changing menu-highlighting along with view changes.
