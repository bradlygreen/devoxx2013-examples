Devoxx 2013 Examples
===================

Example code I used in the AngularJS University session at Devoxx 2013 in Antwerp.  Slides for [AngularJS End to End](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/presentation/d/1eQ3q_Y3Q2ra4PzWHrQ_E60Ar1-2IRooXI4P-fW0npzQ/view?pli=1#slide=id.p49).

Nothing too interesting here, though the 7-mail-app directory may be useful for folks new to AngularJS who want to see how to set up deep linking that includes changing menu-highlighting along with view changes.
